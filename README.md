## Collect statistics on the use of open source

TOAST UI AppLoader applies Google Analytics (GA) to collect statistics on the use of open source, in order to identify how widely TOAST UI AppLoader is used throughout the world. It also serves as important index to determine the future course of projects. location.hostname (e.g. > “ui.toast.com") is to be collected and the sole purpose is nothing but to measure statistics on the usage. To disable GA, use the following `usageStatistics` options when creating the instance.

```js
var options = {
    ...
    usageStatistics: false
}
var instance = new AppLoader(options);
```

Or, include `tui-code-snippet.js` (**v1.5.0** or **later**) and then immediately write the options as follows:

```js
tui.usageStatistics = false;
```


## 🎨 Features
* Supports various options of url schemes for app calls.
* Supports `Universal link` that does not need to set fallback url for iOS9+.
* Supports  `intentURI` for Chromium 25+.
* Sets the time to delay app calls.


## 🐾 Examples
* [Basic](https://nhnent.github.io/tui.app-loader/latest/tutorial-example01-basic.html) : Example using default options.

More examples can be found on the left sidebar of each example page, and have fun with it.


## 💾 Install

TOAST UI products can be used by using the package manager or downloading the source directly.
However, we highly recommend using the package manager.

### Via Package Manager

You can conveniently install it using the commands provided by each package manager.
When using npm, be sure to use it in the environment [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/ko/) is installed.

#### npm

``` sh
$ npm install --save tui-app-loader # Latest version
$ npm install --save tui-app-loader@<version> # Specific version
```

#### bower

``` sh
$ bower install tui-app-loader # Latest version
$ bower install tui-app-loader#<tag> # Specific version
```

### Via Contents Delivery Network (CDN)
TOAST UI products are available over the CDN powered by [TOAST Cloud](https://www.toast.com).

You can use the CDN as below.

```html
<script src="https://uicdn.toast.com/tui-app-loader/latest/tui-app-loader.js"></script>
```

If you want to use a specific version, use the tag name instead of `latest` in the url's path.

The CDN directory has the following structure.

```
tui-app-loader/
├─ latest/
│  ├─ tui-app-loader.js
│  └─ tui-app-loader.min.js
├─ v2.1.0/
│  ├─ ...
```

## 🔨 Usage

### HTML

This component does not require the container element.

### JavaScript

This component can be used by creating an instance with the constructor function.
To get the constructor function, you should import the module using one of the following ways depending on your environment.

#### Using namespace in browser environment
``` javascript
var AppLoader = tui.AppLoader;
```

#### Using module format in node environment
``` javascript
var AppLoader = require('tui-app-loader'); /* CommonJS */
```

``` javascript
import {AppLoader} from 'tui-app-loader'; /* ES6 */
```


You should call `exec` method with [options](http://nhnent.github.io/tui.app-loader/latest/AppLoader.html#exec) after creating an instance.

``` javascript
var instance = new AppLoader();

instance.exec({ ... });
```
